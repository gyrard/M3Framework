(?patient sf:Have_This_Symptom sf:Sadness),
(?patient sf:Have_This_Symptom sf:Fatigue),
(?patient sf:Have_This_Symptom sf:Sleep_Disturbance),

The rule indicates that if a patient has the symptoms of “Sadness”, “Fatigue”, etc., then the outcome for the patient may be “Dysthymia”.

# Obtrusive Sleep Apnea (OSA)


# Heart rate has a strong link with strokes and heart attacks in people who have OSA because sleep disorders influence the autonomic nervous system and can cause heart rate disturbances [18].
# A heart rate monitor placed on the elery's chest is used to monitor the heart rate during sleep, considering that 12:00 am to 06:00 am is the interval with a high risk of a heart attack [19].
# [18] Paper: Comparison of detrended fluctuation analysis and spectral analysis for heart rate variability in sleep and sleep apnea [Penzel et al. 2003]
# [19] Paper: Day-nigh pattern of sudden death in obstructive sleep apnea [Gami et al. 2005]

# [20] Paper: Does snoring intensity correlate with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea? [Maimon et al. 2010]
# Snoring intensity: snoring is a major symptom of OSA and its intensity is closely correlated with the severity of this syndrome, that is, the intesity of snoring increases as OSA becomes more severe [20].
# Therefore, it is necessary to detect snoring and assess its intensity.
# To do this, a 3-pin sound sensor module is used and located in the elderly person's room.

# BeWell computes a wellbeing score for sleep behavior within a single day using a gaussian function
# February 2019

# sleep_day (HR_act) = Ae exp (- ((HR_act - HR_ideal) power 2 )/2 * ( (HR-hi - HR_lo) power 2) )
# HR_act = total quantity of sleep over 24 hour period
# HR_ideal = ideal hours asleep, by default = 7 hours
# HR_hi = upper limit of acceptable sleep duration, by default = 9 hours
# HR_lo = lower limit of acceptable sleep duration, by default = 5 hours

# Physical Activities Compendium Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) value to be estimated each day

# Center for Disease Control and Prevention: http://www.cdc.gov
# Our daily scores of physical activity are simply a linear regression
# physical_day (MET_act) = (MET_hi - MET_lo)*MET_act + MET_lo
# MET_act is the actual value for a user during that day
# MET_hi high guidelines for adult aerobic activity set by the CDC
# MET_lo minimum guidelines for adult aerobic activity set by the CDC
# Values between 300 and 150 minutes and moderate-intensity per week.
# Such aeroboic activity should be accompanied by muscle-strenghthening programs

# Activity = {driving, stationary, running, walking}

# we measure social isolation based on the total duration of ambient conversations, which are detected by inferences made using the mobile phone microphone.
# social_day (DUR_act) = ((DUR_hi - (DUR_lo) * (DUR_act) + DUR_lo)
# DUR_act = duration of conversation detected relative to the total time the microphone is active during a single day.
# DUR_hi = 0.35 using the  mean conversation ratio of a small 10 person experiment
# DUR_lo = 0
