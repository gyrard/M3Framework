<h3>Abstract: From Internet of Things to Semantic Web of Things </h3>

An ever growing interest and wide adoption of

<img src="images/ISWC2016Tutorial/InternetOfThings.png" width="80" height="80" title="Internet of Things (IoT)" alt="Internet of Things (IoT)"/></a>
 technologies unleash a true potential of designing a broad range of high-quality consumer applications. Smart cities, smart buildings, and e-health are among various application domains which are benefited from IoT technologies. 
 Diversity, dynamicity and heterogeneity of devices, networks and data are among major challenges 
 hindering the wide adoption of IoT technologies. <br/>
 
 <img src="images/ISWC2016Tutorial/SemanticWeb.png" width="70" height="70" title="Semantic Web" alt="Semantic Web"/> technologies 
 have been effectively used in various domains, particularly, 
 to address the heterogeneity challenge to:
 <ul>
 <li>Ease the interconnection of such data</li>
  <li>Deduce new knowledge to build smart applications</li>
   <li>Maintain interoperability at data processing, management and storage</li>
 </ul>
 
  We will familiarize our audience with the "evolution" of IoT called Web of things (WoT) 
  which is based on existing Web standards. 
  Combining
  <img src="images/ISWC2016Tutorial/SemanticWeb.png" width="70" height="70" title="Semantic Web" alt="Semantic Web"/> and Web of Things technologies pave the way for the Semantic Web of Things. 
This tutorial will introduce the basics of Internet of Things and 
<a href="http://webofthings.org/"><img src="images/ISWC2016Tutorial/WebOfThings.png" width="150" height="150" title="Web of Things (WoT)" alt="Web of Things (WoT)"/></a>
 in order to enable the rapid development of semantics-based Web of Things applications. 
 Towards that goal, the tutorial will also demonstrate how semantic web technologies are employed 
 for semantic annotation and reasoning on data to build interoperable IoT/WoT applications. 
 One key aspect is helping IoT developers in dealing with semantic web technologies by reducing 
 the learning curve as much as possible. We will showcase real-world use case scenarios 
 which are designed using semantically enabled IoT frameworks 
 (e.g.  <a href="http://www.ict-citypulse.eu/page/"><img src="images/iotproject/citypulse.png" width="100" height="100" title="CityPulse EU project" alt="CityPulse EU project"/></a>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
In recent years, we have been witnessing a growing number of sensors embedded in smart devices 
or everyday objects. Applications exploiting sensors and producing data are more and more popular. 
More than <a href="http://www.ict-citypulse.eu/scenarios/scenarios">100 scenarios</a> have been referenced
by IoT projects such as continuous health care, smart home, smart orchard, detecting road conditions 
or air pollution countermeasures. However, one of the challenging problem 
with the existing IoT applications is 
that devices are not/or little interoperable with each other since their data is based on proprietary
formats and they do not use common terms or vocabulary to describe interoperable IoT data. 
Semantic web technologies have already shown their benefits in other domains than IoT. 
IoT interoperability is still in its infancy phase. Semantic web technologies can be employed in IoT 
to overcome the challenge in dealing with interoperability of data produced by devices 
already employed in real-life. 

Through this tutorial, we aim to bridge this gap between IoT and Semantic worlds 
by providing the participants with an overview of the existing IoT approaches with their pros 
and cons and how the limitations of existing IoT platforms can be overcome with semantic web technologies.
Moreover, we aim to provide the participants hands-on experience that will guide them 
to choose a right approach for their needs to develop their semantics-based IoT applications.

The main benefit of this tutorial is helping developers in dealing with semantic web technologies 
by reducing the learning curve as much as possible. We are expecting that the tutorial will encourage semantic web experts to spread our approach of easing the integration of semantic web technologies in other domains than IoT.

	<td>Abstract</td>
	<td>The tutorial will start with an introduction aimed at setting a common context 
between the IoT and SWoT for all participants. 
It will provide an understanding of commonly used terminology 
by presenting a domain model. 
This is followed by a discussion on Common Service Functions (CSFs) to build IoT ecosystems 
including uniform metadata exchange, 
device registration, resource discovery, device management, data management and repository. 
The entire ecosystem is highly fragmented due to individualized implementations of these CSFs 
as well as data-silos arising due to non-uniform treatment of IoT data originating at 
heterogeneous domains. To mitigate these issues, <a href="http://www.onem2m.org/">oneM2M</a> partnership project (an initiative to standardize IoT by standard development organizations around the world) is exploiting semantic web technologies. 
Techniques for rapid application development will then be discussed which are based on 
(i) such architecture, (ii) model-based development, 
(iii) macro-programming  languages and compilers (iv) node-centric programming such as 
<a href="http://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a>.

These concepts will be delivered using examples with code snippets. 
We will present hands-on tips to start with the IoT application development 
immediately and demonstrate our current project 
<a href="https://github.com/pankeshlinux/IoTSuite">IoTSuite</a>, a toolkit for prototyping IoT applications.

<tr>
	<td>Abstract</td>
	<td>Utilizing the RESTful web services, standards and best practices can bring harmony and interoperability among the IoT platforms and ecosystems. In this session, we will leverage the IoT
concepts described previously and combine it with the Web, thus preparing foundation for the next session on -- ``Semantic Web of Things''. We will start this
session by some motivation scenarios for the WoT. 
The session will highlight semantics for thing description such as <a href="json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>,
 <a href="https://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a>; and standardization efforts by 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">W3C WoT Interest Group (IG)</a>. The WoT IG activities are split into four Task Forces (TFs). Among them the TF on Thing Description is looking into semantic-based representation of things while TF of Discovery examines semantic-based discovery. Benefits of utilizing the semantic web technologies will be thoroughly highlighted. We will discuss how the presented WoT and Semantic Web concepts 
can be integrated in real-world WoT applications.</td>

<h3>Part III: Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) platforms - 30 mins</h3>

<table border>

<tr>
	<td>Abstract</td>
	<td>While the previous sessions outline the benefits of  integrating semantic web 
	technologies to IoT and WoT, this session dives deeper into semantics. 
	It explains the way to semantically annotate data produced by IoT devices by using the 
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn">W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) ontology</a> 
	and the <a href="http://sensormeasurement.appspot.com/m3#">Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) ontology</a> 
to unify terms to describe sensor data. 
M3 Framework has been designed to assist developers in developing semantics-based WoT applications. M3 enables enriching IoT data with meaningful information using logic-based inference engine 
	(e.g., deducing hot from an outdoor temperature) 
but also enables combining IoT application domains.
The design of the M3 semantic engine is flexible enough to be deployed at a cloud or a Gateway or 
even an Android powered device.
This section will extend and improve the tutorial online exploiting the semantic engine.
The M3 semantic engine will be explained in this context and the hands-on session will enable 
to use it in practice.

	<td>Abstract</td>
	<td>


Realizing the true potential of semantic technologies, various IoT frameworks have been proposed 
which address the data interoperability issues using the Semantic Web technologies and standards. 
In this session, we will demonstrate practical scenarios designed in the context of 
smart cities projects, which leverage the benefits of 
semantic interoperability and provide real-time data analytics solutions for large-scale IoT data 
streams. We will showcase a real-time data analytics and decision support 
applications (City Route Planner and Parking Space Finder) developed for the City of Aarhus, Denmark 
using the CityPulse Framework. Both applications process 
real-time IoT data streams and perform real-time data analytics using semantic technologies and 
user-centric decision support. We will also demonstrate a second related to the

 <img src="images/fiesta.png" width="100" height="100" title="FIESTA-IoT H2020 EU project" alt="FIESTA-IoT H2020 EU project"/></a> EU project ensuring semantic interoperability of IoT data,
 testbeds and experiments/applications. It reuses the semantic engine presented in the previous section.
 Sensor data produced by smart cities such as Santander in Spain is exploited and 
combined with other data coming from others cities such as Galway in Ireland and Guildford in United Kingdom.
 A set of <a href="http://fiesta-iot-tools.appspot.com/">FIESTA-IoT Tools</a> can be used to register and discover testbeds and experiments to later run the experiment to provide smart IoT applications to end-users.

<a href="http://www.ict-citypulse.eu/page/">

 <h2>Prerequisite knowledge</h2>
 Since this tutorial is for ISWC, we assume that attendees have some basics regarding semantic web languages and ontologies. 
 <br/>The knowledge of a semantic web framework such as:
 <a href="https://jena.apache.org/">Jena</a>  and the set up of the Eclipse environment and Java 1.7 already done would be appreciated. 
We will provide basics to understand IoT and WoT in our presentations.  
<br/>Our step-by-step tutorial will guide people to use both WoT and semantic web to develop 
Semantic Web of Things applications.<br/><br/>


In case you are not familiar with semantic web technologies, we can guide you to learn the basics: <br/>
