<h1>Sorry! We are refactoring our web site!</h1>
<div class="hero-unit">



Perhaps the web page has been moved to the following web sites:

<ul>

	<li>All tutorials and state of the arts are being moved to <a href="http://semantic-web-of-things.appspot.com/">Towards an E-Learning Platform for Semantic Web of Things</a></li>
	<li>All things related to Smeantic Web Best Practices are being moved to <a href="http://perfectsemanticweb.appspot.com/">PerfectO portal references and classifies tools 
to encourage Semantic Web Best Practices to achieve Semantic Interoperability. 
</a></li>
</ul>



Maybe the page that you are requesting has been renamed. Please see the home page or the menu to find what you are looking for.
